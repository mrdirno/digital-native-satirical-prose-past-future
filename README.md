### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Sam finds a second anomalous book, this one predicting a specific, mundane event from her own past with eerie accuracy.
- Create a series of 'Culinary Adventures for One' recipe cards based on the cookbook Sam finds, each with a satirical, melancholic, or philosophical headnote.
- Write a short story from the perspective of Leo, detailing his transition from UI designer to bookshop owner and his true motivation for buying 'Papyrus & Pixel'.
- Compose the 'transmission' Sam receives when she finally puts her phone down for 24 hours, written in the style of the blue book's prose.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Literary Landfill' generator that creates satirical book titles, blurbs, and inscriptions for obsolete genres (e.g., 1970s self-help, 1980s corporate thrillers).
- Design a 'Vigilant Coma' browser extension that replaces social media feed content with randomly generated, poetic observations about digital life in the style of the blue book.
